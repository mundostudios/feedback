# Mundo Community Repo

## Mundo Public Roadmap

In this repository, you can find Mundo's [public roadmap](https://github.com/mundostudios/community/projects/1). Our roadmap is where you can learn about what projects and features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Join the discussion over on the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/mundostudios/community/discussions).

### Project stages

Project stages for our projects indicate the phase that the product or feature goes through, from intiial devlopement to general availability. The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to its current stage. Be sure to read the [roadmap disclaimer](#roadmap-disclaimer) below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline.

## Mundo Feedback Forum

In this repository, you can find the official GitHub public feedback discussions for all of Mundo's products.

These discussions are where you can share suggestions for how the products should be improved and discuss those improvements with the community, including members of the Mundo's teams. Check out [Making suggestions](#making-suggestions) to learn how to provide feedback.

### Making suggestions

We encourage you to open a discussion if you have suggestions for how we can improve our products. You don't need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion. We are hoping to foster productive and collaborative conversations, so please check out how to give good feedback if you want some guidance on how to kick off a successful discussion.

Prior to making a new discussion, please take a look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already brought to our attention your suggestions. If you find a similar discussion reply with additional details or react to signal your support rather than creating a new discussion.

### From a suggestion to a shipped feature

Once you kick off a discussion, we will evaluate the feedback but will not be able to respond to every submission. If we determine that we are going to prioritise a feature to solve the problem you've identified, we may open an issue and track it's development in the public roadmap.
If the product team determines that we will not be working to solve the problem you have identified we may comment on the discussion describing our reasoning so our decisions can remain transparent.
